# Voice-Control-Robo-Car

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a modern technology buzzword that makes everyday objects smarter. The concept of the Internet of Things extends beyond smartphones and computers to make vehicles, homes and communities intelligent. The most pressing concern about growing vehicle use is the rising frequency of traffic accidents. The issue with modern automobiles is that they do not offer us safety, which might lead to tragic accidents.[1]

The concept of IoT in vehicles was developed to ensure the safety and efficiency of road conditions. It is a dynamic mobile communication system between cars and humans that are supposed to deliver real-time road traffic information, safeguard journey comfort, and increase transport efficiency. 
In recent years, the smart car sector has been increasing enormously in the IoT market. Furthermore, the number of smart cars seems set to increase over the next few years. This goal will be achieved because the application of recent IoT technologies to the automotive sector opens up innovative opportunities for the mobility of the future, in which connected cars will be more and more prominent in smart cities.[2]

This project describes the implementation of a voice-controlled robotic car using Arduino.Here, the user gives specific voice commands to the robot through an Android application installed on the smartphone. On the receiving side, a Bluetooth transceiver module receives the commands and forwards them to the Arduino on the robotic car. Arduino controls the movements of the robot according to received commands. The robot moves forwards, backwards, left and right, and stops according to the voice commands forward, reverse, left, right and stop, respectively. 

This report aims to provide an overview of the prototype based on the integration of IoT technology with the automobile sector, taking into account technological, transport, and social features.
